### <u>Update 1.1</u> (Finishing the base components and structure)

We've finished the components and structure for the app, including a home page, profile page, projects page as well as basic authentication, search functions and basic implementations of a card view and project database.

**<u>Details that need to be improved on</u>****

 First things first is definitely the overall structure of the application in terms of the codebase, as for now it still feels very puzzled together in random pieces and making it work. 
 
 Secondly, the profile page is still sort of shady, and needs some work for sure. Try to generally organise the codebase and implement some sort of system for components. 
 
 ### <u>Targets</u>
 
 Our target by the next update should be having a cleaner codebase, better profile page and starting to use our authentication for features such as bios, sales status and things of that nature.
